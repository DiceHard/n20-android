__Vision__
The goal to teest against is this: When you use the app, does it make Role Playing Games Easier?
Faster? More Convenient? More fun? Basically, is it better?

What isn't better? How can we make was isn't better as good? 
How can we make what _is_ better 10 times better?

__Product Roadmap__
  1. Dice Roller.
   - As a player, I want to use the diceroller just like I use my dice so that I have another tool for spontaneous role playing.
   - As a player, I want to shake the phone to roll the dice so that I feel more like I am rolling dice (fun), and less like I'm using a calculator (less fun).
   - As a player, I want the accelorometer to play a role in seeding the random number generator so I can feel I'm taking my fate into my own hands.
   - As a player, I want to alter the initial facing of the dice so I can "Train the die" and also so that I can take my fate into my own hands.
   - As a player, I want to be able to keep track of what is and is not working in brining me luck so that I can improve my chances.
   - As a player, I want the dice I have to be like my actual dice, they should have quirks that individual dice have that I can't control. 
   - As a player, I want to be able to collect "good dice" and throw away "bad dice".
   - As a player, I want to be able to put misbehaving dice in a "Dice Jail" so I can shame them into roling better.
   - As a player, I would like the dice to roll either as randomly as possible or as realistically as possible so I don't think "It's just a calculator!" and ruin the magic.

  2. Character Sheet Shirpa.
   - As a player, I want to have my character sheets always available and editable on the app, so I can have all of my tools in the same place.
   - As a player, I want to be able to create characters right on my phone so that I don't need sheets of paper and a printer to make that happen.
   - As a player, I want to be able to take a picture of my existing character sheets to back them up and use them with the app.
   - As a player, I want to be able to update my character sheet as I play the same way I'd do with a pencil and paper character sheet.
   - As a player, I'd like my dice rolls to automatically update my character sheet for generation and other activities.

  3. GM tools.
   - As a Game Master, I want a place where I can organize all my notes and have them ready to play at the drop of a hat.
   - As a Game Master, I need a messaging system so that I can pass players secret notes that other players should not know about.
   - As a Game Master, I want to see the results of my player's rolls, and assign their character sheets damage or other effects without having to broadcast that to the whole group.
   - As a game master, I need a tool to create encounters and a battlemap that both the players and myself can interact with so that battles can flow quickly and be more exciting.

  4. Expanded usage.
   - It'd be nice to be able to toggle between Physics engines and random number generators.
   - It'd be nice to be able to forge new dice, or even buy exotic dice through in-app purchases.
   - It'd be nice to have really exotic physics: Change gravity, or whther the dice falls through air, water, or peanut oil, or dice made out of outlandish materials, or dice boxes or any other weirdly tweakable thing.
