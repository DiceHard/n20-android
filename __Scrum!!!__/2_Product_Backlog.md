  1. Dice Roller.
   - As a player, I want to use the diceroller just like I use my dice so that I have another tool for spontaneous role playing.
   - As a player, I want to shake the phone to roll the dice so that I feel more like I am rolling dice (fun), and less like I'm using a calculator (less fun).
   - As a player, I want the accelorometer to play a role in seeding the random number generator so I can feel I'm taking my fate into my own hands.
   - As a player, I want to alter the initial facing of the dice so I can "Train the die" and also so that I can take my fate into my own hands.
   - As a player, I want to be able to keep track of what is and is not working in brining me luck so that I can improve my chances.
   - As a player, I want the dice I have to be like my actual dice, they should have quirks that individual dice have that I can't control. 
   - As a player, I want to be able to collect "good dice" and throw away "bad dice".
   - As a player, I want to be able to put misbehaving dice in a "Dice Jail" so I can shame them into roling better.
   - As a player, I would like the dice to roll either as randomly as possible or as realistically as possible so I don't think "It's just a calculator!" and ruin the magic.
