__Dice Hard n20__ 
_An RP minion_

Dice Hard n20 is an android app that has the mission of making Table Top Role Playing Games easier.

There are a lot of numbers and rules to know about, but spending time with those things takes you out of the spontaneous story-telling, like when you decide to take a dump on the the bed of the evil king's castle.

Iteration 1:
D20 Dice roller!
  - Tap the big red button to roll the die.
  - Swipe across the screen to change the die's face-up side to "Train the die".
  - Yes, the number facing, whether you train it or not, _DOES_ influence the outcome!
